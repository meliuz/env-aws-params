# env-aws-params

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gmr/env-aws-params.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gmr/env-aws-params)

``env-aws-params`` is a tool that injects AWS EC2 Systems Manager (SSM)
[Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html)
Key / Value pairs as [Environment Variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable)
when executing an application. It is intended to be used as a Docker
[Entrypoint](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint),
but can really be used to launch applications outside of Docker as well.

The primary goal is to provide a way of injecting environment variables for
[12 Factor](https://12factor.net) applications that have their configuration defined
in the SSM Parameter store. It was directly inspired by
[envconsul](https://github.com/hashicorp/envconsul).

## Example Usage

Create parameters in Parameter Store:

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter --name /service-prefix/ENV_VAR1 --value example
aws ssm put-parameter --name /service-prefix/ENV_VAR2 --value test-value
```

Then use ``env-aws-params`` to have bash display the env vars it was called with:

```bash
env-aws-params --prefix /service-prefix /bin/bash -c set
```

If you want to include common and service specific values, ``--prefix`` can be specified
multiple times:

```bash
env-aws-params --prefix /common /bin/bash -c set
```

## CLI Options

Run `env-aws-params --help` for available options.
